How to INSTALL


for an example app where we can control the GUI in Java
and we have Python code running in the background.
       src/com/tudelft/triblerdroid/first/SwiftActivity.java
is the main entry point.
       res/raw/script.py
contains the Python code that is run.

To run this yourself, install Android SDK:
   http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
(I'm using Android 4.0 as that is what the test phone runs).
And then install your own copy of Scripting-for-Android,
following these instructions:
http://jokar-johnk.blogspot.com/2011/02/how-to-make-android-app-with-sl4a.html
I've used the offical repository
       https://android-scripting.googlecode.com/hg/
Not the rjmatthews62 one.

This gives you a large set of projects (modules of Scripting4Android).
For a number of those I had to set the Android target to Standard 4.0, and build quickaction.jar by hand.

A thing to check is if the Android Service class that is now used
is what we need, we may need to create a separate thread/process as services are not separate threads by default.

Current status:
  16Feb: runs on Samsung Galaxy Nexus only
         functionality: streaming download engine works (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-ppsp-peer-protocol/)
         Mixing with Python, still unstable
